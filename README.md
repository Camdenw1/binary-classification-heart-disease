# binary-classification-heart-disease
## Project Overview
This project involves performing binary classification to predict the presence of heart disease based on a dataset of patient information. Using various machine learning techniques, I implemented and compared models to classify individuals as either having or not having heart disease. This repository includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## Key Learnings

### Data Preprocessing:

Handling categorical and numerical features using ColumnTransformer.
Standardizing numerical features with StandardScaler.
One-hot encoding categorical features.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing data distributions and relationships using histograms and heatmaps.
Understanding feature correlations and their impact on the target variable.
Model Implementation:

Training and evaluating models like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Implementing hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and KFold cross-validation.

### Performance Metrics:

Using accuracy, confusion matrices, and cross-validation scores to evaluate model performance.
Understanding the trade-offs between different models and parameter settings.
